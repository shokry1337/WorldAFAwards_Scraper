# ðŸ¥ƒ World AFA Awards Scraper

This project is a **web scraper** built with **Crawlee** [**Playwright**], designed to extract beverage product data from the [World AFA Awards](https://worldafawards.com/results/2025) results page. It saves structured product data to a CSV file, avoiding duplicates and handling UI interactions like modals and cookie popups.
